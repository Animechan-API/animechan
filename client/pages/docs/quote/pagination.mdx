# Pagination

Pagination is only a few supported endpoints that returns an array instead of a single object.

Currently supported pagination endpoints:
1. [Get quotes by anime](/quotes-via-anime)
2. [Get quotes by character](/quotes-via-character)

### Usage
```sh
/quotes/?anime=<anime>&page=<page_number>
```

### Return
It will return an `array` of [`Quote`](/quote) object

### Example:
> We are using the built-in global `fetch` API here, which is both available in browser and NodeJS as of now. But you can use any other programming language or request lib.

```js
const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/quotes?anime=${animeName}&page=2`)
const quote = await response.json()
```
