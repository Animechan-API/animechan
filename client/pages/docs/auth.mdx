# Authentication

Some of the endpoints are protected and require a secret API key, which you can obtain by becoming a [premium member](/get-premium). Authentication with the `x-api-key` header is necessary to access these premium API endpoints that require the premium API key.

Here is how to authenticate using a secret API key:

```js
const response = fetch(`${BASE_URL}/quotes/random/1`, {
		headers: {
				'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
		},
});
const quote = await response.json()
```
