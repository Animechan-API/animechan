> [!IMPORTANT]
> **THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY STOPPED DUE TO INCREASED HOSTING AND DATABASE BILLS!!!** \
> Due to the escalating costs associated with higher traffic, including server, database, and routing service fees, I have decided to temporarily suspend this project, which I have self-funded for nearly three to four years. However, I am exploring the introduction of a premium version with enhanced features in the future. For now, the project will be paused. If you value this project and wish to see it continue, please consider supporting me through [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/rocktimsaikia/). Thank you for showing love and support for this project till now. I hope to bring it back soon.

## About

[![EC2 Deploy](https://github.com/rocktimsaikia/animechan/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rocktimsaikia/animechan/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

Animechan is a side project I started in 2020 because I could not find an API that provides anime quotes. So I ended up creating this API so that you don't have to.

## Updates

> :bulb: Here are the major updates of the project since its inception:

1. _(2020)_: Developed the API using KoaJS, deployed the backend on Heroku, while implementing the frontend with NextJS hosted on Vercel.
2. _(Nov 24, 2022)_: Transitioned server-side hosting to Render from Heroku, in response to [Heroku discontinuing their free dyno plans](https://blog.heroku.com/new-low-cost-plans).
3. _(Jun 24, 2023)_: Relocated the entire project, including both backend and frontend, to AWS and acquired the new domain animechan.xyz.
4. _(Dec 21, 2023)_: Released the API's backend server code as open source.
5. _(Feb 4, 2024)_: Migrated the database to PlanetScale.
