# Authentication

All API endpoints are free to use, but there are rate limits in place. The free tier allows 5 API requests per hour. For higher usage limits (1000 requests per hour), you can obtain an API key by becoming a [supporter](/support). Authentication with the `x-api-key` header is necessary to access the API with higher rate limits.

Here is how to authenticate using a secret API key:

```js
const response = fetch(`${BASE_URL}/quotes/random?anime=ReLIFE`, {
		headers: {
				'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
		},
});
const quote = await response.json()
```
